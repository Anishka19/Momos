1. Finely cut all vegetables as mentioned in the ingredients section.

2. Add 3/4 cup Maida(all purpose flour), 1 teaspoon oil and salt in a large bowl.

3. Mix all ingredientswell and prepare a soft pliable dough(like paratha dough) by adding water as needed. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 20-25 minutes.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan over medium flame. Add finely chopped ginger and garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add green onion and sauté for a minute.

5. Add all chopped vegetables(carrot, cabbage, capsicum and green beans) and salt to the pan.

6. Mix well and sauté them for 4-5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon chilli sauce.

7. Add 1/2-1 teaspoon soy sauce.

8. Add 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder.

9. Mix well and sauté for a minute. Turn off the flame. Stuffing for Veg Momos is ready.

10. Knead the dough again for a minute and divide it into 2-equal portions. Give each portion a round cylindrical shape like cucumber. Cut each one into 6-7 equal portions with a knife.

11. Give each small portion a round shape like ball and flatten it a little into pattie by pressing it in between yor palms. Cover them with a wet cloth or a plate to prevent them from drying.

12. Place one dough pattie on a rolling board and roll it out into a thin disc(approx. 4-5 inch diameter). Roll it from sides and keep the center portion little thick compared to sides. If required, sprinkle some dry flour while rolling.

13. Place approx. 1 tablespoon filling in the center. Don't over-stuff it, otherwise ot will be difficult to get a proper "potli" shape.

14. Lift the edge from one side and start pleating(fold the edge a little inside and then little outside alternatively). Join them in the center to seal it.

15. Prepare momos from remaining dough patties in a similar way.

16. Grease a steamer plate or any other plate(it should easily fit into the steamer or a deep vessel) with oil to prevent the momos from sticking to it. You can also line a plate with cabbage leaf instead of greasing the surface with oil. Arrange the Veg Momos on a plate in a way that there is some space around them to expand.

17. Heat 1-2 glass of water in a steamer or a deep vessel over medium flame.

18. Place stand in the steamer and place the momos plate over it. Cover the steamer/vessel with a lid and steam them for 6-7 minutes over medium flame or until they look a little translucent and shiny. Remove the lid and check them by touching it. If they don't feel sticky then it means they are cooked.

19. Transfer them to a serving plate.
